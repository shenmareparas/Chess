## 🧠 AI Algorithm

The chess AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning** to determine optimal moves:

### How It Works

1. **Minimax Algorithm**: Evaluates the game tree by simulating moves and counter-moves
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes search by eliminating branches that won't affect the final decision
3. **Advanced Optimizations**: Utilizes Quiescence Search, Null Move Pruning, and Late Move Reductions (LMR)
4. **Depth-Based Difficulty**:
    - Level 1: Depth 1 (1 half-move lookahead)
    - Level 2: Depth 2 (1 full move)
    - Level 3: Depth 3 (1.5 full moves)
    - Level 4: Depth 4 (2 full moves)
    - Level 5: Depth 5 (2.5 full moves)

### Position Evaluation

The AI evaluates positions based on:

-   Material advantage (piece values)
-   Piece positioning and mobility
-   King safety
-   Pawn structure
-   Control of center squares

## ⚙️ Configuration

The app stores user preferences locally using SharedPreferences:

-   Selected theme
-   Piece theme preference
-   Move history visibility
-   Sound settings
-   Hint display settings
-   Board Rotation preference
-   Board Notation visibility
-   Undo/Redo availability

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Start a New Game**: From the main menu, configure your game settings
2. **Select Mode**: Choose between 1-player (vs AI) or 2-player mode
3. **Choose Difficulty**: For AI games, select from 5 difficulty levels
4. **Customize**: Pick your preferred theme and piece style
5. **Play**: Tap pieces to select them, then tap valid squares to move
